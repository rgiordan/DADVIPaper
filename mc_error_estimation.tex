In this section we show how to estimate the Monte Carlo error of the output of
DADVI. Since this estimate is based on use of the implicit function theorem, as
we saw for LR covariances, it is again not as readily available to ADVI.

Let $\fun(\eta)$ denote some quantity of interest, such as a posterior
expectation of the form $\fun(\eta) = \expect{\q(\theta \vert
\eta)}{\phi_1(\theta)}$ as in the previous \cref{sec:linear_response}.  We are
now interested in the sampling variance of $\fun(\etahat) - \fun(\etastar)$ due
to the Monte Carlo randomness in $\Z$. We can apply standard asymptotic theory
for the variance of M-estimators to find that this sampling variance is, in the
notation of \cref{sec:linear_response}, consistently estimated by
%
\begin{align}\label{eq:mc_variance}
%
\var{\normz}{\fun(\etahat) - \fun(\etastar)}
\approx{}&
\frac{1}{\sqrt{N}} \grad{\eta}{\fun(\etaopt)}^\trans
\h^{-1} \scorecov \h^{-1}
\grad{\eta}{\fun(\etaopt)},  \\
\quad\textrm{where}\quad
\scorecov :={}&
\meann \grad{\eta}{\klobj{\etahat | \z_n}}
\grad{\eta}{\klobj{\etahat | \z_n}}^\trans. \nonumber
%
\end{align}
%
\Cref{eq:mc_variance} is analogous to the ``sandwich covariance'' estimate for
misspecified maximum likelihood models \citep{stefanski:2002:mestimation}.
Indeed, the question of how variable the DADVI estimate $\etahat$ is under
sampling of $\Z$ is exactly the same as asking how variable a misspecified
maximum likelihood estimator (or any M-estimator) is under sampling of the data,
and the same conceptual tools can be applied.  To complete the analogy, our
$\scorecov$ plays the role of the empirical score covariance, and $\h$ plays the
role of the empirical Fisher information.

Analogously to our discussion of LR covariances in \cref{sec:linear_response},
we briefly note that the classical derivation of \cref{eq:mc_variance} is based
on a Taylor series expansion of the first-order condition
$\grad{\eta}{\klobj{\eta \vert \Z}} = 0$, and so is not applicable to
estimators like ADVI that do not satisfy any computable first-order conditions.
