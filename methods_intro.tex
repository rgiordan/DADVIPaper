In what follows, we start by establishing the requisite notation and 
the various forms of automatic differentiation variational inference (ADVI).
Then we introduce our new method 
``deterministic automatic differentiation variational inference'' (DADVI),
describe how it facilitates LR
covariances, and show how to compute its Monte Carlo error.
