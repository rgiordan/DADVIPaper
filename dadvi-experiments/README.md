The code to run the experiments is currently in the repository
[martiningram/dadvi-experiments](https://github.com/martiningram/dadvi-experiments)
pending some final updates to the documentation and reproducibility.
Once those updates are finished, we will copy the experiments code to this
location for ease of access in conjuction with the paper.
